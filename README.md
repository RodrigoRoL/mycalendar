# Mycalendar

## Description

The aim of this challenge was to create a calendar app, where you can put your daily schedule that can be shared with anyone you want, so they can see your day to day schedule. This easy interface allows you to block you day from a work day schedule (9-5). You can easily add text and save it using a "save" button that will lock the text you have on any block.


## Usage

1. Open the link of the app
2. Select the time you want to add an event in the textbox.
3. Once you added the text, click the button on the right to "Save" your event.
4. Share your calendar to show your availabilty!

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
